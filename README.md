1. Turtle Race Game 🏁
This one lets you bet on a turtle and see which one wins the race. It's totally random, so don't blame me if your turtle loses 😆.
You'll get a pop-up asking for your bet, then the race begins. The turtles go zoom... or sometimes crawl, but that's part of the fun.

2. Smooth Turtle Movement (WASD Controls) 🎮
This one is a little turtle you can control using your keyboard (WASD keys). I tried to make it so you can hold keys together (like W + A) and move in circles. Took me a bit to figure it out, but it works!
You can clear the screen with C too if it gets messy.

👉 File: turtle_wasd_move.py (or whatever name you gave it)

Notes:
Run them with any Python IDE or terminal.

You’ll need the turtle module, but that comes with Python, so you’re good.

They're just for fun—nothing too serious, but I learned a lot while making them.

Feel free to try them, break them, or change them however you want.
Have fun coding 🧠💻
